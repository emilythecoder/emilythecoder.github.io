        <h2>All About ATM</h2>

         <h3>What is ATM?</h3>
            <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet and you can take the 3 year program at 
            Bancroft Middle School. It gives students a chance to learn the importance of computers.
            You learn so many things, such as photoshop, typing, code, etc. It's a really fun program. 
            </p>
        
        <h3>In 6th grade, we learned how to type and make posters.</h3>

        <h3>Reflection of ATM</h3>
         <p>I think ATM is a very good program for kids who enjoy learning about technology. 
         It is really fun but can be difficult to keep up with sometimes. Im grateful to be in ATM, 
         I have learned many things that I think I can benefit from when I'm older. </p>
