         <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>Some of the skills I have is being good at ela and sometimes science.
            I enjoy reading interesting stories sometimes. I am also skilled at helping people out and being 
            there for them. I know what to do during emergencies and I know how to react.
            I am also good at many sports, such as soccer, football, softball, and volleyball. 
            But I stuggle at math a lot, which is a bad thing.</p>
